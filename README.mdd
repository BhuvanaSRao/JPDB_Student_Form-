Student Enrollment Form (JPDB Project)

This is a simple and clean mini-project built using HTML, JavaScript, and JSONPowerDB (JPDB).
The form allows you to save and update student information based on a unique Roll Number — all without writing any backend or server code.

It’s a perfect example of how powerful a serverless database like JPDB can be for quick CRUD applications.

🚀 Features

Here’s what the form can do:

🔍 Detect student automatically by Roll Number

🆕 If the Roll Number doesn’t exist, the form switches to Save Mode

✏️ If the Roll Number already exists, the form loads the data and enters Update Mode

✔️ Ensures all fields are filled before saving/updating

💾 Saves and updates data in JSONPowerDB in real time

⚡ Uses jQuery + JPDB API for smooth AJAX requests

🎨 Simple and clean interface that's easy to use

🗄️ Database Details (JPDB)

Your entire backend is powered by JSONPowerDB.

Database Name: SCHOOL-DB

Table (Relation): STUDENT-TABLE

Primary Key: Roll-No

✨ The best part? You don’t manually create this database.
JPDB automatically creates it the moment you save your first record.

📌 How the Project Works
1️⃣ On Page Load

Only the Roll Number field is active.
All other fields and buttons are disabled to prevent wrong data entry.

2️⃣ Enter a Roll Number

If JPDB finds a match → existing data loads → Update Mode

If no match is found → the form unlocks → Save Mode

3️⃣ Save / Update

Save inserts a new student record into JPDB

Update modifies the existing one

Everything happens instantly using JPDB’s REST API.

🧩 How to Run the Project

Running this project is super simple:

Download the folder

Open student_form.html in a browser (Chrome / Edge)

Type a Roll No and click outside the field

The form will automatically unlock

Enter details → press Save

For existing Roll No → modify data → press Update

No installations, servers, or databases needed!

📁 Folder Structure (Human-Friendly)

Here’s what the project folder looks like:

JPDB_Student_Form/
│
├── student_form.html    ← The main file you will open and run
└── README.md            ← This project documentation


That’s it — just two files. Simple and clean.
